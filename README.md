# JavaScript Loop Variable Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript loops where the loop variable is not properly initialized or updated, leading to infinite loops or unexpected behavior. The example uses a `while` loop, but similar issues can occur with `for` loops.

## Bug

The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code. The loop variable is updated incorrectly in certain cases, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version of the code, demonstrating how to properly manage the loop variable to avoid errors. This fixes the update statement and prevents the infinite loop or unexpected behavior.
